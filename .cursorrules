# CreatorSync Cursor Rules

## Project Context

### CreatorSync Application Overview
CreatorSync is a multi-platform social media publishing application that allows users to create, preview, and publish content across multiple social media platforms from a single interface.

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React.js with Clerk authentication
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **AI Services**: Python FastAPI backend for caption/hashtag generation
- **Authentication**: Clerk for user management
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 for media uploads

### Key Components
- **Platform Publisher**: Multi-platform content creation and publishing
- **OAuth Integration**: Twitter and LinkedIn authentication
- **Content Generation**: AI-powered captions and hashtags
- **Media Management**: Image/video upload and processing
- **Scheduling**: Post scheduling functionality (planned)

### Current Status
- **LinkedIn**: ✅ Fully working - OAuth, publishing, URL generation
- **Twitter**: 🔧 In development - OAuth working, publishing needs testing
- **Other Platforms**: 📋 Planned (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube)

```

### Development Workflow
1. **Feature Branch**: Always work on `feature/twitter-posting` branch
2. **Platform Focus**: Work on one platform at a time
3. **Testing**: Test thoroughly before committing
4. **Merge**: Merge to main only when stable

## Platform Isolation Rules

### CRITICAL: When working on one platform, DO NOT modify others

**LinkedIn Platform - OFF LIMITS (Working Perfectly):**
- DO NOT modify `back/backend-node/routes/linkedinAuth.js`
- DO NOT modify `back/backend-node/services/linkedinUserService.js`
- DO NOT modify `back/backend-node/models/LinkedInToken.js`
- DO NOT modify LinkedIn-related parts of `platformPublisher.js`
- DO NOT modify LinkedIn publishing routes
- LinkedIn is working perfectly - LEAVE IT ALONE

**Twitter Platform - Safe to Modify:**
- Safe to modify `back/backend-node/routes/twitterAuth.js`
- Safe to modify `back/backend-node/services/twitterService.js`
- Safe to modify `back/backend-node/models/TwitterToken.js`
- Safe to modify Twitter-related parts of `platformPublisher.js`

**Frontend Components - Multi-platform Safe:**
- Safe to modify `frontend/src/components/PlatformPreviewPanel.jsx` (UI improvements)
- Safe to modify `frontend/src/api/index.js` (API integration)
- Safe to modify other frontend components

### General Rules

1. **Always check which platform you're working on before making changes**
2. **If a platform is working, do not touch its files**
3. **Test thoroughly before committing changes**
4. **Focus on one platform at a time**
5. **Document any changes made**

### File Modification Guidelines

**Before modifying any file:**
1. Identify which platform the file belongs to
2. Check if that platform is currently working
3. If working, DO NOT modify
4. If not working or needs improvement, proceed carefully

**When working on Twitter:**
- Focus only on Twitter-related files
- Do not touch LinkedIn files
- Test Twitter functionality thoroughly

**When working on LinkedIn:**
- DO NOT touch LinkedIn files (they work perfectly)
- Focus on other platforms or general improvements

### Testing Requirements

1. **Always test the platform you're modifying**
2. **Verify other platforms still work after changes**
3. **Run the app and test publishing functionality**
4. **Check for any breaking changes**

### Commit Guidelines

1. **Clear commit messages indicating which platform was modified**
2. **Test before committing**
3. **Document any API changes**
4. **Update documentation if needed**
