# Cursor Operational Rules

- Always run the full start script after any code change:
  - `./start-app.sh` (this stops conflicting processes, starts Node, Python, and the React frontend, and verifies status).
- Do not skip; rerun the script every time edits are applied so services pick up changes.
-run it continously without stopping to ask for proceeding and avoid false message that app is running before completing and checking all ports and launcing the login page
